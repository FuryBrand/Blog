Some friends asked, what does my network ID `FuryBrand` mean. [Fury](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2713180/) is the movie about World War II; [Brand](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/brand/) is one of Champions from the League of Legends. As known as "the Burning Vengeance". There is no special meaning, it's just simply combined. Maybe it can be compared to the "El Psy Kongroo" from "Steins;Gate".
